Binary Bomb / Bomb Lab/ Assembly Bomb/ Dr Evil's Binary Bomb

- What is this?
This is lab assignments taken from WPI CS2011 INTRODUCTION TO MACHINE ORGANIZATION AND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE on Programming Systems with Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective text book in use.
The purpose of this lab assignment is to familiarize yourself with machine-level programs and the tools that you can use to understand them. You will do this by defusing a Binary Bomb produced by Dr. Evil, a nefarious Canadian.
Answers for this lab may or may not result in perfect scores as the server generate different bomb for different account.
I use gdb to solve all the bomb included in this repository.
